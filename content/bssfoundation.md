# What is Bss Foundation?
In the past, there were a few attempts to make a free and open-source ecosystem on top of Linux systems, projects like Pear OS which had pear ID, etc.  
  
Many years ago the idea of having a Group that makes free and open-source software like KDE and Gnome and having an entire ecosystem of software, came to my mind. That's why I established BSS Foundation.

P.S.: BSS stands for nothing.

# Goals

The goals are simple, we want to make free and opensource software for everybody's use case and an entire ecosystem.

Our Base system (Parch Gnu/Linux) is getting more stable in the future, after that it gets fully stable, we will start building the basic applications for the ecosystem.
