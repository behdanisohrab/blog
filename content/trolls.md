Trolls are, unfortunately, a fact of life for anyone who dares to create or contribute to a public-facing project. As the developer of Parch Linux, I've experienced this firsthand, especially in Persian-speaking online communities like Telegram groups. Over the years, what began as occasional jokes has turned into a persistent source of frustration, often undermining the serious work and effort I've put into this project.

### The Name Game

One recurring issue stems from the name of the project: "Parch." In Persian, "Parch" translates to "pitcher" (as in a water pitcher). This unintended meaning has often been the source of jokes and misunderstandings, particularly from people who don't take the project seriously. While these remarks might seem harmless at first, they’ve compounded over time, turning into a recurring distraction.

To address this, I’ve considered rebranding to emphasize the correct pronunciation and meaning: "P-Arch." This name not only highlights the project's connection to Arch Linux but also better conveys its technical essence. My hope is that by clarifying the branding, I can shift the narrative from irrelevant humor to the genuine value and goals of the project.

### Three Years and Counting

Unfortunately, despite efforts to steer conversations toward the project's technical aspects, the trolling has only intensified over the past three years. It’s no longer just light-hearted teasing; it has become a deliberate effort to mock and harass. Recently, fake accounts were even created on Mastodon to spread false accusations and hurl insults at me. Such actions are disheartening and drain the energy I would rather invest in improving the project.

### Why Does This Happen?

I’ve often wondered why this behavior persists. Is it the immaturity of the trolls? Are they simply seeking attention, hoping to provoke a reaction? Or is it something deeper—perhaps a reflection of the online culture in certain spaces? Whatever the reason, it’s exhausting to deal with this negativity while trying to build something meaningful.

### Balancing Community and Sanity

I’ve seriously considered withdrawing from Persian-speaking Telegram groups altogether. However, I have friends and supporters in these groups who genuinely appreciate my work. Leaving would mean distancing myself from them as well, which makes the decision all the more difficult.

That said, the toxic behavior I’ve encountered has made it increasingly hard to justify staying. There’s only so much one can endure before the mental toll outweighs the benefits of engagement.

### A Hard Truth

A friend once told me, “Creating a project, especially a free one for the Persian-speaking community, is a waste of time. All you’ll get in return is insults.” At the time, I brushed off this comment, believing in the value of contributing to an open-source ecosystem and the potential to make a difference. But after years of dealing with relentless negativity, I can’t help but feel the weight of those words.

### Moving Forward

Despite these challenges, my commitment to Parch Linux remains steadfast. I believe in its potential and its ability to provide value to users. However, moving forward, I plan to focus on fostering a more positive and supportive community—one that values collaboration and respects the effort behind open-source contributions.

To anyone reading this who has faced similar challenges: You’re not alone. Building something meaningful in the face of adversity is never easy, but it’s worth it for those who truly benefit from your work. And to those who troll: Consider redirecting your energy toward creating something of your own. You might just find it’s far more fulfilling than tearing others down.

Thank you to everyone who has supported Parch Linux through thick and thin. Your encouragement keeps me going.
