## Divan Abzar: Your Persian Workshop for Mastering Software Craftsmanship

This white paper proposes "Divan Abzar," a new feature inspired by Microsoft's Dev Nest. But instead of a nest, imagine a bustling **workshop**, a vibrant Persian "Khana Kod" (House of Code) where software artisans gather to create and collaborate. Like its cultural namesake, Divan Abzar will be a centralized **place** within ParchLinux, specifically designed to streamline your development workflow and elevate your coding experience.

### Why Do We Need This Workshop?

Currently, navigating ParchLinux for development can feel like searching for tools in a disorganized bazaar. Scattered scripts and disparate sources make project management and environment setup cumbersome. With Divan Abzar, these scattered tools will find their **rightful place**, organized and readily accessible within a user-friendly interface.
